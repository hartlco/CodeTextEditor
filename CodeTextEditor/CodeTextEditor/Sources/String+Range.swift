 Negative location accesses elements from the end of element counting backwards.
 e.g. `location == -1` is the last character / last.
 
 Likewise, negative length can be used to select rest elements except the last one element.
 e.g. `location: 3`, `length: -1` where string has 10 lines.
 -> element 3 to 9 (NSRange(3, 6)) will be retruned
 
 
 Well, this category is not so useful as you thought.
